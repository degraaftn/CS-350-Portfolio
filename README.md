1. Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Artemis Financial is a financial management company that wanted to make their financial software secure.

2. What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

I think I did a good job in adding the code for the algorithm cipher, considering my utter lack of experience in this area and having no context for any of this.

3. What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

All of it was challenging. I felt like I was thrown into the deep end of the pool and told to float without any instuction as to how to actually do so.

4. How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

I'm not sure I actually did add layers of security beyond implementing the checksum and certificate. In the future I hope I would have some concept of what a fully mitigated application looks like and how to go about implementing those mitigations.

5. How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

I actually did not get to that point. I was never able to run the application successfully, could not locate the problem, and was not able to access localhost to verify the checksum. If I had made enough progress to actually start eliminating further vulnerabilities, I would have continued to run the dependency checks to see if I had introduced any new ones.

6. What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

God, I hope I understood any of this well enough to understand how to apply in future assignments and tasks.

7. Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

If I were to use this assignment as an example of anything, it's my determination to do my best and figure out what I can even when I feel like I have no idea what I'm doing.
